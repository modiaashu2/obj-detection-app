# Object Detection App

A Flutter project to detect objects from images.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application with Machine Learning.

It uses tensorflow's model which is run on a server to detect objects.
The response returned is the address of static image which is again taken up by the server to return the image.
